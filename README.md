## Persona: 
Employee in a technology firm that 1) often uses Slack to communicate 2) is emotionally aware 3) is unafraid of inputting personal information into a Slackbot

## Problem to Solve: 
When employees face an emotionally challenging situation in the workplace (ex. I had a meeting that was incredibly infuriating), they don't have a mechanism for coping with the problem. Bring a psychotherapy staple - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - to employees when they need it.
